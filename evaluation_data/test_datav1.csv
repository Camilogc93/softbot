0,What role do listening skills play in the coaching process according to the participants?,"['93 \nWhether being present, allowing space or being patient, concentration is clear, as Jill \nsuggests: “It’s pretty hard not to learn how to concentrate when you’re one-on-one with \nsomebody” [Jill-F]. Participants are prepared to focus; apparently, not being present, \nbeing impatient or not allowing space can hamper coaching.  \nParticipants notice thinking activity. Susan highlights the decision-making required: “I \nfound quite hard [deciding] whether to be directional or non-directional, and involved or \nnot, or empathising or relating to my scenario, or shutting up or just listening” [Susan-F]. \nPeter perceives the need to allow thinking time for the coachee and himself: “I need to \nallow time for silence to let him think and process [and] that would give me chance to \nthink” [Peter-1]. Bill suggests reflection on what happened in sessions happens naturally: \n“You’re reflecting with the coachee, then you go away and think whether the sessions \nwent well” [Bill-F]. He also directly suggests the coaching is the cause of increased self-\nreflection: “I was always trying to reflect on myself, but I do it more since the coaching” \n[Bill-3].  \nThere is a sense of self-control while thinking. Jill expresses the need to avoid sympathy \nand to maintain the objective stance: “I do have a tendency when people are having hard \ntimes to sympathise [saying] oh isn’t this awful, I understand [; I] force myself to remain \nobjective” [Jill-3]. Jill is using the term objective as a way of distancing herself from the \nemotions, which is an expectation of the coach role. Cox and Bachkirova (2007) highlight \nthe coach can feel emotion when coaching; control of emotions is stated as ‘good and \nnecessary’ (p184) but that empathy is needed for the coachee’s emotion, rather than \nidentification with the emotion. \nLike Jill, other participants notice when their usual behaviour needs managing. Peter \nrelates his natural leadership: “I kept on wanting to complete the conversation and \ncharacteristically [I] like to turn things into a leadership role.” [Peter-1]. Mark, too, admits a \nnatural tendency to find solutions: “[I need to act] as a coach, which is what I’m supposed \nto do, rather than coming up with solutions.” [Mark-3]. Thus, coaching practice gives the \nopportunity to learn not to lead.  \nMark recognises impatience is a natural trait, though conscious effort may lessen its \naffect:  \n“inwardly I’m still impatient, so the listening skills are improved but only through the \nconscious effort of listening and trying to understand [and] also, in becoming less \nimpatient” [Mark-F]. \nAdèle’s simple statement “I’m becoming more curious” [Adèle-3] suggests coaching \npractice can modify perceived traits. \n']","Listening skills play a crucial role in the coaching process as participants highlight the need for patience and allowing thinking time for both the coach and the coachee. Mark mentions that his listening skills have improved through conscious effort, indicating that effective listening is essential for understanding and facilitating the coaching process.

In this study, the training took a clear stance at odds with traditional \ncommand and control style management, to aim to not give any direction at all. \nHeightened awareness of relationship characteristics such as focused attention, rapport, \ntrust, respect and empathy was apparent in project managers. These characteristics \nrepresent linkage between communication and relationship-building skills that are \nrecognised in coaching. Rogers (2008) argues that coaching works because of the \ncoaching relationship, a partnership for supporting change based on trust, rapport and \nempathy. She gives an example of a coach showing poor respect to the coachee, but that \n‘the intention to help [was] so strongly conveyed’ that some positive outcomes resulted. \nThe ICF competency list too demands an agreed and trusting relationship, use of \nlistening, questioning and direct communication skills and having intentions that feedback \noccurs and the client takes positive action. This study suggests that novice coaches gain \nthe ability for effective communication that is underpinned by a good relationship and is \nuseful outside of coaching, to support another person to reflect and act.  \nRegarding personal skills, this study corroborates the very little literature suggesting \nbenefit from learning to act as coach. Reflection and self-coaching results in improved \nleadership skills (Mukherjee, 2012) and self-efficacy (Van Nieuwerburg and Tong, 2013; \nAmmentorp and Kofoed, 2010).

Though training is \nencouraged (Carbone and Gholston, 2004) and may happen at university (Alam et al, \n2010), it may not give practical benefit (Egginton, 2012; Lee-Kelley and Blackman, 2012). \nCoaching is recommended for feedback and ongoing support (Bourne and Walker, 2004). \nThis study aims that project managers adopt the philosophy and skills of coaching, which \ncould help to reinforce the value of feedback and support.

4,What is the significance of building a trusting coaching relationship between the coach and the coachee?,"['9 \nrecommends that the person coaching, the coach, builds a trusting relationship with the \nperson receiving coaching, the coachee, and uses soft skills to progress the coachee’s \nagenda (Rogers, 2008). Thinking skills are required to adopt a coaching philosophy \n(Western, 2016): in organisations coaching may focus on organisational performance \n(Garvey et al, 2014), and specific criteria such as employee wellness (Grant, 2017). The \nfacilitation of learning emerges as an alignment of employee and organisational agendas \n(Beattie, Kim, Hagen, Egan, Ellinger and Hamlin, 2014). Coaching is generally understood \nto have an intention that the coachee learns (Cox, 2013). Despite limited emphasis on \ncoach benefits, coaches are guided towards continual personal development, including \ncoach supervision, which enables them to learn from their coaching practice (Hawkins, \n2010). Coaches are thus privileged over non-coaches in their soft-skills development; their \nlearning can also be used in any situation not just when coaching.  \nIn relation to soft skills, there is a generally perceived need in ‘today’s service-oriented \nand information-focused market-place’ (Matteson et al, 2016, p80). Yet, definition of soft \nskills is considered challenging (Riggio and Tan, 2014), even a ‘humpty dumpty’ term \nwithout meaning (Hurrell, Scholarios and Thompson, 2013, p161). However, definition is \npotentially no more challenging than for the terms coaching and project manager role, due \nto contextual variability. Development is challenged by the contextual meaning; real \npractice is recommended with feedback (Levasseur, 2013; Matteson et al, 2016). Soft \nskills cover a broad set of skills which apply to interactions with others (interpersonal \nskills) and to individual actions (personal skills; Matteson et al, 2016). Soft-skills \ndevelopment may not be common for adults but more concerted efforts are being made in \nschools and universities (Koenig, 2011; Humphrey, 2013; Tang, 2018). Levasseur (2013) \nnotes that technical people have mostly trained through personal study, thus soft skills are \nnot naturally gained from traditional courses.  \nAwareness of the need for soft skills in project managers is emerging from a historical \nemphasis on the technical skills promoted by professional organisations that focus on \neffective project delivery (Pant and Baroudi, 2008). Employers aim to recruit project \nmanagers with soft skills (Pinkowska and Lent, 2011) but may need to develop staff \n(Egginton, 2012). Svejvig and Andersen (2015) provide a literature review on the \nRethinking Project Management initiative, RPM, with 74 papers dated from 1983 that \nhighlights social and political aspects as one of six themes arising from the desire for \nproject managers’ education to take a broader perspective. A modern definition of a \nproject as ‘a temporary set of roles tied together by channels of communication to achieve \nchange’ (Thompson, 2017) reinforces the importance of relationships and working \ntogether, and covers any need for negotiation in social and political situations. \n']","Building a trusting relationship between the coach and the coachee is significant because it allows the coach to use soft skills to progress the coachee's agenda, facilitating effective learning and development.

This study questions whether training and \npractice would be helpful to more employees than managers. \nThe participative action research study provided initial coach training to seven project \nmanagers, then each one was introduced to their coachee, and left to organise six \ncoaching sessions over six months. Interviews after each of the first three and the last \ncoaching sessions gathered data relating to learned and applied soft skills. Using a \npragmatist philosophy, thematic analysis and abduction, learned and applied soft skills \nhave been identified from project managers’ descriptions. Coach-like soft skills were \nlearned, adapted and valued, resulting in personal growth for project managers who \nbecame more supportive or collaborative with work colleagues. Rather than becoming \ncoaches, project managers use the soft skills learning to work more effectively. According \nto Bloom’s taxonomy (Krathwohl, 2002), the creative stage is reached because learned \nskills are tuned to work needs. Even though adoption of a coach-like philosophy is \napparent from the data, work goals set a boundary to applied skills. Yet the positive \nresponse from seven project managers suggests that using coaching practice for soft-\nskills development has potential for wider use, particularly improved collaboration. \nThe literature review highlighted a gap in how the coach benefits from coaching. In the \nstudy, project managers did not find coaching practice easy, but expressed personal \ngrowth that made them feel better able to do their job. The review also highlighted gaps in \nthe understanding of soft skills, the development of soft skills particularly for project \nmanagers and the activities of managerial coaching, along with a potential gap in \nunderstanding managers’ motivation to coach.

11,How do PM coaching methods affect team dynamics and project success?,"['146 \nA methodological contribution is claimed from the use of these stick figures, because the \nproject managers did not actually draw them. Their imagined drawing apparently helped to \nelicit their knowing about their personal experience. In addition, having one artist draw the \nfigures from the descriptive words means that they can be compared visually. \nPresentational knowing has been claimed, but the words suggest a more definite \npropositional knowing (Heron and Reason, 1997) about leadership and acting differently \nwith others. In contrast, the project manager who did not imagine a stick figure may have \nexpressed thoughts that were not quite so well-formulated about his personal change. The \nimages and words highlight a sense of growth for all project managers, and most reflect \nthat interacting with other people is part of the growth.  \nIn summary, novice coaches can use coaching skills in all their relationships, not just \nwhen coaching. This is an important advantage for building effective relationships through \nmore flexible communication built on trust.  \n7.2. Benefits of coaching practice to managers  \nThe findings concur with managerial coaching literature that the soft skills of coaching can \nprovide a means to achieve work goals (Grant, 2017). They challenge though, current \nrealities in respect of development of both coach and coachee. The personal benefits to \nmanagers are little recognised similarly to novice coaches. In addition, managers’ \ncoaching activities for developing staff are questioned; managers may only coach to work \ngoals.  \nThe project managers showed they applied their coaching techniques at work with \ndifferent behaviour such as being more supportive to colleagues. Communications and \nrelationship-building have the potential to improve project success (Hagen and Park, \n2013) and project managers used their new skills to change work relationships. Project \nmanagers are similar to other managers in their role to encourage staff to achieve \nperformance goals, so managers could use coaching skills in similar ways. \nCounter-intuitively, project managers found value in investing time in supporting others \nmore because better information can be shared. Plans and workload could be negotiated; \nteam-buy-in and less stress for the manager could result. Coaching is limited, though; the \nvalued learned skills may be restricted to those shown in figure 7.2. Compared to figure \n6.9, project managers may not want to cope as coach or use sensing direction beyond \nletting others drive tasks.

A coaching culture can encourage coach training \n(Garvey et al, 2014) and motivate practice. This study questions whether training and \npractice would be helpful to more employees than managers. \nThe participative action research study provided initial coach training to seven project \nmanagers, then each one was introduced to their coachee, and left to organise six \ncoaching sessions over six months. Interviews after each of the first three and the last \ncoaching sessions gathered data relating to learned and applied soft skills. Using a \npragmatist philosophy, thematic analysis and abduction, learned and applied soft skills \nhave been identified from project managers’ descriptions. Coach-like soft skills were \nlearned, adapted and valued, resulting in personal growth for project managers who \nbecame more supportive or collaborative with work colleagues. Rather than becoming \ncoaches, project managers use the soft skills learning to work more effectively. According \nto Bloom’s taxonomy (Krathwohl, 2002), the creative stage is reached because learned \nskills are tuned to work needs. Even though adoption of a coach-like philosophy is \napparent from the data, work goals set a boundary to applied skills. Yet the positive \nresponse from seven project managers suggests that using coaching practice for soft-\nskills development has potential for wider use, particularly improved collaboration. \nThe literature review highlighted a gap in how the coach benefits from coaching. In the \nstudy, project managers did not find coaching practice easy, but expressed personal \ngrowth that made them feel better able to do their job. The review also highlighted gaps in \nthe understanding of soft skills, the development of soft skills particularly for project \nmanagers and the activities of managerial coaching, along with a potential gap in \nunderstanding managers’ motivation to coach. Three contributions follow. The first \nacknowledges the benefits to novice coaches from coaching practice by developing soft \nskills understanding and flexibility. This includes a methodological contribution of using \nstick figure drawings to highlight personal growth for project managers. The second \npresents the benefits of coaching practice to managers that may help to explain activities \nand motivation. The way project managers used the skills may help any manager to \nunderstand the benefits of having the option of adopting a coach-like, non-directive \nphilosophy.

12,How do coaching and soft skills impact project managers' careers?,"['10 \nIncreasingly universities are offering project management courses that recognise the need \nfor soft-skills development (Shelley, 2015). Literature outside of the search can \nrecommend coaching skills (Berg and Karlsen, 2016). Project managers tend to have self-\nresponsibility for their careers and move positions for different leadership experiences \n(El-Sabaa, 2001). There is little direction on soft-skills development. \nCoaching as part of managerial practice was considered appropriate to review, because \nproject management is done in organisations, and project managers sit at many different \nlevels in a hierarchy, but typically at a similar level to managers or below. Managers may \n– or may not – act as coach (Conway, 2013; Gilley, Gilley and Kouider, 2010) which may \nrelate to motivation (Hunt and Weintraub, 2010), but is potentially because organisations \nadopt different cultural approaches to coaching. In an organisation using both internal and \nexternal coaches, Ogilvy and Ellam-Dyson (2012) interviewed eighteen coachees and \ntwelve line-managers (who had been trained as coaches) about the content of managerial \ncoaching. They found the manager influential in the decision for a coachee to have \ncoaching (from an internal coach), and in the setting of the goals for coaching, but not \ninvolved in the contracting between coach and coachee, nor closure of coaching. In that \nenvironment, the coaching was separate to the manager-employee relationship. Rock and \nDonde (2008a) indicated in another case study of an organisation where over 100 internal \ncoaches were trained, the participating trained managers reported that learned coaching \nskills affected their behaviour outside formal coaching: examples given are ‘how they run \ntheir meetings, organize their time, and interact in daily conversations’ (p12). There is little \nempirical evidence in general of the results of managerial coaching (Beattie et al, 2014). \nRafferty and Fairbrother (2015, p1) highlight ‘the process by which health professionals \ntranslate manager-as-coach training into successful practice outcomes, has remained \nlargely unexplored’.  \nThe review shows that coaching depends on maintaining a collaborative relationship and \nuse of communication skills (Rogers, 2008); relating and communication skills are key \n(Maltbia et al, 2014). Soft skills are not clearly understood (Claxton et al, 2016; Matteson \net al, 2016) but relate to human interactions such as coaching. The importance of soft \nskills in project management  (Svejvig and Andersen, 2015) is becoming clear but \ndevelopment may only be ad hoc through experience (El-Sabaa, 2001). A gap exists to \nexplore coaching practice as a soft-skills development approach.   \n1.4. Definitions  \nThe literature uses different terminology for soft skills.

15,How are coaching soft skills linked to project managers' interpersonal needs?,"['9 \nrecommends that the person coaching, the coach, builds a trusting relationship with the \nperson receiving coaching, the coachee, and uses soft skills to progress the coachee’s \nagenda (Rogers, 2008). Thinking skills are required to adopt a coaching philosophy \n(Western, 2016): in organisations coaching may focus on organisational performance \n(Garvey et al, 2014), and specific criteria such as employee wellness (Grant, 2017). The \nfacilitation of learning emerges as an alignment of employee and organisational agendas \n(Beattie, Kim, Hagen, Egan, Ellinger and Hamlin, 2014). Coaching is generally understood \nto have an intention that the coachee learns (Cox, 2013). Despite limited emphasis on \ncoach benefits, coaches are guided towards continual personal development, including \ncoach supervision, which enables them to learn from their coaching practice (Hawkins, \n2010). Coaches are thus privileged over non-coaches in their soft-skills development; their \nlearning can also be used in any situation not just when coaching.  \nIn relation to soft skills, there is a generally perceived need in ‘today’s service-oriented \nand information-focused market-place’ (Matteson et al, 2016, p80). Yet, definition of soft \nskills is considered challenging (Riggio and Tan, 2014), even a ‘humpty dumpty’ term \nwithout meaning (Hurrell, Scholarios and Thompson, 2013, p161). However, definition is \npotentially no more challenging than for the terms coaching and project manager role, due \nto contextual variability. Development is challenged by the contextual meaning; real \npractice is recommended with feedback (Levasseur, 2013; Matteson et al, 2016). Soft \nskills cover a broad set of skills which apply to interactions with others (interpersonal \nskills) and to individual actions (personal skills; Matteson et al, 2016). Soft-skills \ndevelopment may not be common for adults but more concerted efforts are being made in \nschools and universities (Koenig, 2011; Humphrey, 2013; Tang, 2018). Levasseur (2013) \nnotes that technical people have mostly trained through personal study, thus soft skills are \nnot naturally gained from traditional courses.  \nAwareness of the need for soft skills in project managers is emerging from a historical \nemphasis on the technical skills promoted by professional organisations that focus on \neffective project delivery (Pant and Baroudi, 2008). Employers aim to recruit project \nmanagers with soft skills (Pinkowska and Lent, 2011) but may need to develop staff \n(Egginton, 2012). Svejvig and Andersen (2015) provide a literature review on the \nRethinking Project Management initiative, RPM, with 74 papers dated from 1983 that \nhighlights social and political aspects as one of six themes arising from the desire for \nproject managers’ education to take a broader perspective. A modern definition of a \nproject as ‘a temporary set of roles tied together by channels of communication to achieve \nchange’ (Thompson, 2017) reinforces the importance of relationships and working \ntogether, and covers any need for negotiation in social and political situations. \n']","The context discusses the importance of soft skills in coaching and their relevance to project managers, highlighting that awareness of the need for soft skills in project managers is emerging due to a historical emphasis on technical skills.
