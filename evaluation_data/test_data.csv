They argue that it is not enough to retrain people who have lost their jobs, and that the \ndevelopment of soft skills should be introduced in early childhood, especially for children of \ndisadvantaged families. Similarly, the OECD (2015) argues that skills acquired in early childhood are \nskills that contribute to both individual well-being and social progress. Since “skills beget skills,” early \ninterventions in social and emotional skills can play an important role in efficiently increasing skills \nand reducing inequalities in education and the labor market (Heckman & Kautz, 2012, p. 453).\nThere are various discourses behind why soft skills should be included in curricula. These have been \nexamined from the global, national, and personal perspectives by UNESCO (2015b) and include \neconomic, social, and humanity-related rationales, as shown in Table 4. Sometimes the drivers behind \nthe integration of soft skills into education are a combination of these discourses and perspectives.\nTable 4\n Rationale for the integration of soft skills in education curricula \nEconomic discourse\nSocial discourse\nHumanity discourse\nGlobal perspective\nCompetitiveness\nSocial progress\nGlobal citizenship\nNational perspective\nGDP*\xa0growth\nHDI**\xa0growth\nNational identity\nPersonal perspective\nEmployability\nCommunity\n“Holistic” formation\nSource:\xa0Adapted from UNESCO, 2015b.\n*\xa0GDP: Gross Domestic Product\n**\xa0HDI: Human Development Index\n', '6\n1. Introduction\nResearch has found that individuals who possess both hard and soft skills are more successful in life \nand work (Majid et al., 2012; Shultz, 2008; Wats & Wats, 2009). However, what exactly soft skills are is \ndebated. Also, there is no consensus about which soft skills are the most essential or how to effectively \nincorporate them into learning (Chamorro-Premuzic et al., 2010).1\nWhile some education systems and schools have integrated teaching soft skills into curricula, the \ndevelopment of these skills has traditionally been neglected (Schulz, 2008). In many European \ncountries, soft skills are considered only in university curricula (Haselberger et al., 2012; Cinque et al., \n2016), if at all. Several scholars argue that training in soft skills at university is too late (e.g., Laureta, \n2018; Heckman & Kautz, 2012). Instead, soft skills need to be introduced early, in the first stage of \neducation or even in early childhood. When soft skills are initiated at an early educational stage, they \ncan continue to be developed and strengthened as an individual matures because, as Heckman and \nKautz (2013) argue, “skills beget skills” (p. 453).2\nThere are various rationales behind why soft skills are important. Many researchers argue schools \nshould teach soft skills in order to support the holistic development of individuals and strengthen \ntheir sense of citizenship (Nussbaum, 2010). According to the Nobel Prize winner James Heckman, \n“soft skills predict one’s success in life,” while having a high IQ and a high EQ are the magical \ncombination that predicts success both in personal and professional life. To illustrate his point \nquantitatively, he described research that compares American high school graduates and General \nEducational Development (GED)3 graduates. He explored whether those who completed GEDs were \nmore likely to have sub-par social skills than high school graduates, and assessed if such traits were \na factor in academic and career performance later in life (Heckman & Kautz, 2012). Research has \nfound that educating students with a broad mix of skills, including soft skills, lays the foundation for \nfuture national prosperity, given that research has found a relationship between human capital and \neconomic growth (Hanushek et al., 2015; Hanushek, Machin & Woessmann 2011).\n1\u200a Scholars have studied soft skills for decades and there are various research directions that propose methodologies to facilitate their development \n(Robles, 2012).\n2\u200a The equation affiliated with Heckman and Kautz (2013, p. 453) is: “The skills an individual has at time (t+1) \nare determined by the interaction of the skills developed in the previous period t, the investment made in the \nperson in period t, and the child’s family background.”\n3\u200a The GED tests are a group of four subject tests, which, when passed, certify that the test taker has United States or Canadian high-school-level \nacademic skills.\n']","Embedding soft skills in education is important for several reasons: it supports the holistic development of individuals, strengthens their sense of citizenship, and predicts success in life. Research indicates that individuals with both hard and soft skills are more successful in life and work. Additionally, early introduction of soft skills can lead to greater academic success, stronger workplace performance, improved interpersonal relationships, and better health and overall well-being. The integration of soft skills into education is also linked to national prosperity, as there is a relationship between human capital and economic growth.",multi_context,"[{'source': './datav2/doc2.pdf', 'file_path': './datav2/doc2.pdf', 'page': 13, 'total_pages': 42, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.1 (Macintosh)', 'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creationDate': ""D:20231017154357+04'00'"", 'modDate': ""D:20231024102520+04'00'"", 'trapped': ''}, {'source': './datav2/doc2.pdf', 'file_path': './datav2/doc2.pdf', 'page': 6, 'total_pages': 42, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 18.1 (Macintosh)', 'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creationDate': ""D:20231017154357+04'00'"", 'modDate': ""D:20231024102520+04'00'"", 'trapped': ''}]",True

17,What key skills boost employability in future jobs?,"['11\nBox 1\nThe changing nature of work and growing demand for soft skills \nThere is a general agreement that new technologies, such as robotics and artificial \nintelligence, are reshaping the world of life and work. Just as jobs are transforming, the \ndemand for workers’ skills is changing too (Arntz et al. 2016; Frey & Osborne, 2013; \nArregui Pabollet et al., 2019; Lordan, 2018; Nedelkoska & Quintini, 2018). Soft skills are \nincreasingly featured in market analyses and reports as workers will need to be able to \nadapt and work together to meet unknown future needs. \nAccording to the World Economic Forum (2020), the skill groups that employers see \nas becoming more prominent in the approach to 2025 include critical thinking and \nanalysis and problem-solving skills, as well as skills in self-management, such as active \nlearning, resilience, stress tolerance, and flexibility. Similarly, a report on the future of \nwork following COVID-19 by McKinsey Global Institute stated, “workers will need to \nlearn more social and emotional skills, as well as technological skills, in order to move \ninto occupations in higher wage brackets” (McKinsey, 2021, p. 18).\nA study by the OECD (2019) looking at work in the future also predicts that workers \nequipped with cognitive and metacognitive skills (e.g., critical thinking), noncognitive \nskills (e.g., empathy, work readiness and collaboration), and digital skills will be a \nbetter fit in future work environments (OECD, 2019). Such forecasts reflect the current \nsituation where workers are expected to earn more in occupations that require a \ncombination of noncognitive skills and moderate or advanced technical skills (Arregui \nPabollet et al., 2019).
